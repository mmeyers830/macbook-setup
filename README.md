After running the script, there are a few small manual things to do as well outlined below.

## VSCode
Sign in through Github and import the settings

## Iterm

### Add Custom Profile
Download [iterm.json](./iterm.json)

> Preferences -> Profiles -> Other Actions -> Import JSON Profiles -> iterm.json
